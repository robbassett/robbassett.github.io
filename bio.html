							<p>I was born in Texas in 1986 where I lived my first 25 years. During this time I developed a number of interest including math, physics, music, and science fiction and did a lot of stupid stuff. Somehow (with much support from my parents) I managed to complete an undergraduate degree in physics while working a number of jobs including Chinese food delivery, burrito artistry, homework gradery, machine shop cleanery, and astronomy researchery.</p>
							<p>In March of 2012 I travelled to Melbourne Australia to undertake a PhD in astrophysics, which turned out to be both terrible and wonderful simultaneosly. I survived the academic crucible, met my future wife, continued to "do" astronomy for another 5 years as a postdoctoral researcher, and adopted two terriers (why?). During this time I honed my skills in coding, developing this endeavor from a painful necessity to a mildly-furstrating pleasure.</p>
							<p>During the COVID years I made the decision (by following the lead of my beautiful wife) to transition into the world of data science. I was extremely fortunate to secure a job as a data scientist in biotherapeutic product development in Australia's largest pharmaceutical company. This most recent era of my life has been extremely interesting and challenging, but has so far been my most fulfulling role.</p>
